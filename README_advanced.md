# Community Proving with Zksync-Era

## Introduction

This project allows users to perform community proving using Zksync-Era. Follow the steps below to set up the necessary
environment and run the prover.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04+ or MacOS
- Bash shell
- wget or curl

## 1. Install Required Components

For Ubuntu users:

```bash
chmod +x install-ubuntu.sh
./install-ubuntu.sh
```

For Mac users:

```bash
chmod +x install-mac.sh
./install-mac.sh
```

> **Note**: These scripts require some manual interactions. If any issues arise, refer to the step-by-step guides
> [here](./setup_instructions_mac.md) for Mac and [here](./setup_instructions_ubuntu.md) for Ubuntu.

## 2. Generate Proving and Verification Keys

Before running the prover, you need to generate the required proving and verification keys. Each (Circuit ID, Round)
pair requires its own corresponding set of keys.

To generate keys for all possible circuits and rounds, use the following command:

```bash
cd prover
./setup.sh
```

> **Note**: Generating all keys will require approximately 400 GB of disk space, and approximately an hour to complete.

If you only need to prove specific circuits, you can download the keys for those circuits individually as described
below.

Example for Circuit ID 1, Round 0:

```bash
wget http://34.29.79.81:8000/setup_basic_1_data.bin
wget http://34.29.79.81:8000/verification_basic_1_key.json
```

Or using curl:

```bash
curl -O http://34.29.79.81:8000/setup_basic_1_data.bin
curl -O http://34.29.79.81:8000/verification_basic_1_key.json
```

Then, place these downloaded files in the following directory:
`zksync-era/prover/vk_setup_data_generator_server_fri/data`.

## 3. Run the Prover

Once everything is set up, run the prover with the following command:

```bash
chmod +x run_prover.sh
./run_prover.sh --server-url http://34.29.79.81:3030 --circuit-ids "(1,0),(2,1)"
```

where server-url is the url of the job distributor, and circuit-ids (x,y) correspond to the Circuits IDs (x) and Rounds
(y) you are willing to prove. For example, (1,0) refers to Circuit ID 1 and Round 0.

> **Note**: On Mac, the prover may crash unexpectedly. If it does, the script will automatically relaunch the prover.
